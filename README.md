# Description
Motivation: The Tundra Trait Team (TTT) database includes field-based measurements of key traits related to plant form and function at 
sites across the tundra biome. This dataset can be used to address theoretical questions about plant strategy and trade-offs, trait-
environment relationships and environmental filtering, and trait variation across scales, to validate satellite data, and to inform earth 
system model parameters. 

Main types of variable contained: The database contains 66,308 measurements of 18 plant traits. The most frequently measured traits (>1000 
observations each) include plant height, leaf area, specific leaf area, leaf fresh and dry mass, leaf dry matter content, leaf nitrogen 
content, leaf carbon content, leaf phosphorus content, seed mass, and stem specific density.

Spatial location and grain: Measurements were collected over the entire northern hemisphere tundra biome, including Arctic sites in Alaska, 
Canada, Greenland, Scandinavia, and Siberia and alpine sites in the European Alps, Colorado Rockies, Caucasus, and Pyrenees. More than 99% 
of observations are georeferenced. 

Time period and grain: All data were collected between 1964 and 2016. A small number of sites have repeated measurements at two or more 
time periods.

Major taxa and level of measurement: Trait measurements were made on 532 terrestrial plant species growing in tundra habitats. Most 
observations are on individuals (>95%), while a small number represent plot or site means per species.
